# Project-1

Title: Doctor Finder
What API you want to use: https://rapidapi.com/palanen/api/betterdoctor-doctor-and-provider-data/details 
I want to find information such as location, adress, and specialty from the api.
Write out what features you will need to build in order to meet MVP: I will need to use the API to create lists of doctors and information on them based on location or specialty. I will need to use two different search buttons based on which way the user searches for the doctor. I will need to edit and create better style using css. 
Stretch goals for additional / advanced features for when you complete your MVP: Adding a feature that allows you to search for symptoms and get results of illnesses the user may have. 
Wireframes showing your app's layout on desktop, tablet, and mobile. These can be as lo-fi or as hi-fi as you want. You don't have to put these in the README, but please upload them to your repository.
