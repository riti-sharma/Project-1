# Project-1

Title: Doctor Finder
API: https://rapidapi.com/palanen/api/betterdoctor-doctor-and-provider-data/details 
I want to find information such as location, adress, and specialty from the api.
Write out what features you will need to build in order to meet MVP: I will need to use the API to create lists of doctors and information on them based on location or specialty. I will need to use two different search buttons based on which way the user searches for the doctor. I will need to edit and create better style using css. 
Stretch goals for additional / advanced features for when you complete your MVP: Adding a feature that allows you to search for symptoms and get results of illnesses the user may have. 

Explanations of the technologies used, the approach taken, a link to your live site, installation instructions, unsolved problems, etc.

I used an API that finds information on doctors and created two search options- one where a doctor can be searched by name and another where a symptom or specialty of the doctor can be searched. When a valid entry in entered and the search button is clicked, a list of the top three results comes up. These results include a bio with important information about three doctors that may be useful according to what was entered by the user. At the top of the page there are three navigational, About, Contact, and FAQS, links that take the user to different sections of the webpage. Link: http://doctor-finder.surge.sh/
